# PARKinetics

“PARKinetics” aims to bring “Big changes with small movements”. We will emulate known stretches and self-administered treatments via mini games that target 1 or more of 5 major symptoms (5 categories) of Parkinson’s disease (PD): balance, facial rigidity, speech, digit dexterity, and posture. We hope to make learning to manage PD from home fun and engaging. The games not only educate the patient but also help track the slow the regression of facial, fine-motor and rhythmic abilities to give them a better understanding of their own abilities.

See final product demo in the video below.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need the following:
1. An Apple computer running macOS
2. XCode installed (11.2.1 and up)
3. iOS simulator installed or iOS device (iOS 10 and up)

## Running the project

1. In the PARKinetics fodler install dependancies with the following command:

```
pip install
```

2. Open the file called PARKinetics.xcworkspace in xcode (NOT the file called PARKinetics.xcodeproj). This file has the dependancies pre installed.

3. Ensure that you are running XCode 11.2.1 and up, and building on iOS 10 and up. Older versions have compatabilitiy issues with this repo.

4. To run the project in XCode, use the keyboard shortcut [cmd][R] or in the toolbar click Product->Run. If the build succeeded, then the iOS simulator should appear with the build project. If the build failed check the console for the errors. Our app is developed for iPad, please ensure to run simulator on iPad Pro(9.7 inch). Note that loading the image assets may take a minute to load.

## Running the tests

To run tests on the project in XCode, use the keyboard shortcut [cmd][U] or in the toolbar click Product->Test. You should see the status of each test (pass or fail) in the left sidebar.
