```
git clone https://github.com/ksackvil/CMPT-275.git
```

2. Open the file called PARKinetics.xcworkspace in xcode (NOT the file called PARKinetics.xcodeproj). This file has the dependancies pre installed.

3. To run the project in XCode, use the keyboard shortcut [cmd][R] or in the toolbar click Product->Run. If the build succeeded, then the iOS simulator should appear with the build project.
